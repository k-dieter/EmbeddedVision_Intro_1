# Introduction into Embedded Vision

Intention of this repository is to create a very quick overview about embedded vision based on OpenCV in combination with Basler professional cameras.
We will use a very cost efficient yet powerful ARM board based on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 called DB4 from Geniatech
You can find more information about the Dragonboard 410c and DB4 here:
